<strong> 2012 一月至二月 開始上課 </strong>

以下摘錄其課程大綱。    

### 創業 Entrepreneurship

#### 精實創業 Lean Launchpad

怎麼把好的點子變成好的公司？
我們現在知道新創公司不是大公司的縮小版。大公司執行已知的商業模型。他們用大公司的工具 -- 商業計畫，損益表，獲利模型..等等，
來幫助更有組織化的執行。

<blockquote>
In contrast startups search for a business model. And all the big company tools are irrelevant in the early days of a startup. This class is not about how to write a business plan. It's not an exercise on how smart you are in a classroom, or how well you use the research library. The end result is not a PowerPoint slide deck for a VC presentation. Instead you will be getting your hands dirty talking to customers, partners, competitors, as you encounter the chaos and uncertainty of how a startup actually works.

#### 科技創業 Technology Entreprenurship

怎麼樣成立一家成功的新創公司？什麼是大公司成功的創業領導力？
你知道概念與真正的機會的差別嗎？你知道創業者是如何組成團隊及聚集資源來成立一家好的企業？

<blockquote>
This class mixes mentor-guided team projects, in-depth case studies, research on the entrepreneurial process, and the opportunity to network and ask questions of Silicon Valley's top entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. For undergraduates of all majors who seek to understand the formation and growth of high-impact start-ups in areas such as information, green/clean, medical and consumer technologies. No prerequisites are necessary but the course is targeted at Juniors and Seniors.

### 電腦科學(Computer Science)


#### 電腦科學101 Computer Science 101


CS101教你最基本的電腦科學概念，即使你從沒聽過什麼是電腦科學。
電腦看起來非常複雜，但實際上，電腦用一些最基本的模式在運作。
CS101將帶你了解電腦是如何運作的模型，了解這些模型對我們使用電腦的現代人是很有用的。

<blockquote>
In CS101, students play and experiment with short bits of "computer code" to bring to life to the power and limitations of computers. Everything works within the browser, so there is no extra software to download or install. CS101 also provides a general background on computers today: what is a computer, what is hardware, what is software, what is the internet. No previous experience is required other than the ability to use a web browser.

#### 機器學習 Machine Learning

機器學習是一門如何讓看起來沒有被程式化的電腦行動的科學。
上一個十年，機器學習讓我們可以創造出，無人駕駛車、聲音辨識、有效的網路搜尋，並大大的改善了我們對人體基因的了解。

<blockquote>
Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.

#### 軟體工程：軟件即服務 Software Engineering for software as service

那些長壽的軟體是如何使用高生產敏捷開發方法來實現軟體即服務（使用Ruby on Rails）？
敏捷開發者不斷的精鍊及重構他們的工作直到顧客滿意為止。

<blockquote>
Agile emphasizes user stories to validate customer requirements; test-driven development to reduce mistakes; biweekly iterations of new software releases; and velocity to measure progress. We will introduce all these elements of the Agile development cycle, and go through one iteration by adding features to a simple app and deploying it on the cloud using tools like Github, Cucumber, RSpec, RCov, Pivotal Tracker, and Heroku.

#### 人機互動 Human-Computer Interaction

如何設計讓人們感到快樂而不是挫折的介面。
學到快速做出介面及評估是不是一個好的介面的方法。

<blockquote>
You'll learn several technique for rapidly prototyping and evaluating multiple interface alternatives — and why rapid prototyping and comparative evaluation are essential to excellent interaction design. You'll learn how to conduct fieldwork with people to help you get design ideas. How to make paper prototypes and low-fidelity mock-ups that are interactive -- and how to use these designs to get feedback from other stakeholders like your teammates, clients, and users. You'll learn principles of visual design so that you can effectively organize and present information with your interfaces.

#### 自然語言處理 Natural Language Processing

<blockquote>
Natural language processing is the technology for dealing with our most ubiquitous product: human language, as it appears in emails, web pages, tweets, product descriptions, newspaper stories, social media, and scientific articles, in thousands of languages and varieties. In the past decade, successful natural language processing applications have become part of our everyday experience, from spelling and grammar correction in word processors to machine translation on the web, from email spam detection to automatic question answering, from detecting people's opinions about products or services to extracting appointments from your email.

#### 賽局理論 Game Theory

賽局理論因為[美麗心靈][bu]這部電影而有名。
[bu]:http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BE%8E%E4%B8%BD%E5%BF%83%E7%81%B5

<blockquote>
Popularized by movies such as "A Beautiful Mind", game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what we call 'games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model eBay, Google keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more. We'll include a variety of examples including classic games and a few applications.

#### 概率圖模型 Probabilistic Graphical Models


<blockquote>
Uncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future, and even in the present and the past, many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained.

#### 密碼學 Cryptography



<blockquote>
Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption, digital signatures, and authentication protocols. Towards the end of the course we will cover more advanced topics such as zero-knowledge, distributed protocols such as secure auctions, and a number of privacy mechanisms. Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.

#### 演算法分析與設計（一）Design and Analysis of Algorithms I


<blockquote>
In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm design. You'll learn the divide-and-conquer design paradigm, with applications to fast sorting, searching, and multiplication. You'll learn several blazingly fast primitives for computing on graphs, such as how to compute connectivity information and shortest paths. Finally, we'll study how allowing the computer to "flip coins" can lead to elegant and practical algorithms and data structures. Learn the answers to questions such as: How do data structures like heaps, hash tables, bloom filters, and balanced search trees actually work, anyway? How come QuickSort runs so fast? What can graph algorithms tell us about the structure of the Web and social networks? Did my 3rd-grade teacher explain only a suboptimal algorithm for multiplying two numbers?
