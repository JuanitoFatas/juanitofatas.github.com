About me.
----------
I love *programming* so so very much.
I love to learn and learn and learn new things.
I've learned so many things. 
But unfortunately I am not really good at one specific field.
Now I will try to keep my heart focus on one specific thing I love the most
at the mean time still keep a open-mind to see new technologies happen!

Programming is analogous to Farming in my opinion. 
You must work very hard till one day you will truly find that 
the Harvest is really really sweet and all hard works are worthy.
During the long path you will see you're growing just like 
back to the time when you learned to walk like a baby.

This blog is mean to share everything I learned.
We came to this world with *nothing*, what's the point to keep things secretly if they're really amazing.
Share and love to share. Make our world better!

I love to make new friends from all over the world.

Contact me by email, I check my email on a hourly basis. 

My email is written in [Brainfuck][1] to avoid web crawlers.
